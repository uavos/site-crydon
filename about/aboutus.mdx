# About Crydon

Crydon Defense Systems Inc. is a U.S.-owned small business focused on **unmanned autonomy and defense solutions**. We work across research, prototyping, and integration to help programs move quickly from requirements to real test outcomes.

## Mission

Deliver resilient autonomy and integration capabilities that create operational advantage — with speed, discipline, and engineering clarity.

## What “Attritable & Scalable” Means to Us

We design systems that can be fielded rapidly, improved iteratively, and tuned through operator feedback — without overcomplicating the solution.

## How We Work

- Clear requirements and mission constraints
- Short build-test-learn loops
- Integration-first engineering (flight controls, comms, payloads)
- Documentation and delivery discipline suitable for defense programs
