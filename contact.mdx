# Contact

If you’re exploring a new unmanned capability, autonomy upgrade, payload integration, or communications architecture, we can help you move from concept to prototype quickly.

## Program Inquiries

- Email: **info@crydontech.com** *(replace with your real mailbox)*
- Website: **crydontech.com** *(or crydon.tech / crydon.us)*

## What to include in your message
- Mission context (e.g., ISR, maritime, disaster response)
- Desired range/endurance/altitude constraints (if applicable)
- Payload type (EO/IR, comms relay, radar, custom)
- Integration environment (GCS, existing autopilot, data links)
- Timeline and test constraints (lab, field, flight)

## Typical response workflow
We reply with a short set of technical questions and propose a next step:
**Discovery call → NDA (if required) → concept brief → prototype plan.**
